Arthur and Goodness prevail if the team of Good is able to sccessfully complete three quests without revealing Merlin's true identity. Mordred's dark forces of Evil triumph when three quests end in failure, or are devious enough to force Merlin into the open.

The game ends immediately after either successful or three failed Quests. The Evil players win if three Quests fail. The game also ends immediately and the Evil players win if five Teams are rejected in a single round.


Assassinate Merlin - Evil's Last Chance

If three Quests are completed successfully, the Evil players will have a final opportunity to win the game by correctly naming which of the Good players is Merlin. Without revealing any Character cards, the Evil players discuss and the layer with the Assassin character card will name one Good player as Merlin. If the named player is Merlin, then Evil players win. If the Evil players do not name Merlin then the Good players win.
