Game play

Four additional Characters with special powers are available to play. You can play with these cards in any combination that you would like. Different combinations will make the game harder to win for one of the side of the battle or the other. It is best to add one special Character card into a game at a time, adding more or changing when you are familiar with how they play. In most cases you will want to play with Merlin, but it is not required. 


Percival

Percival is an optional Character on the side of Good. Percival's special power is knowledge of Merlin at the start of the game. Using Percival's knowledge wisely is key to protecting Merlin's identity. Adding Percival into a game will make the Good side more powerful and win more often. 


Mordred

Mordred is an option Character on  the side of Evil. Mordred's special power is that his identity is not revealed to Merlin at the start of the game. Adding Mordred into a game will make the Evil side more powerful and win more often. 


Oberon

Oberon is an optional Character on the side of Evil. Oberon's special power is that he does not reveal himself to the other Evil players, nor does he gain knowledge of the other Evil players at the start of the game. Oberon is not a "Minion of Mordred" and does not open his eyes during the reveal at the start of the game. Adding OBeron into a game will make the Good side more powerful and win more often.


Morgana

Morgana is an optional Character on the side of Evil. Morgana's special power is that she appears to be Merlin - revealing herself to Percival as Merlin. Adding Morgana into a game will make the Evil side more powerful and win more often.
